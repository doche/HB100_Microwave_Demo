# HB100_Microwave_Demo

This is a KiCad project. At first it is created with KiCad v4. However my PC has installed KiCad v5 and this project was converted to a project of KiCad v5. I am not sure whether there is any problem with KiCad v4 when opening these files.

Dimension of HB100 module can be found in HB100_Microwave_Sensor_Module_Datasheet(1).pdf.
Application circuit can be found in HB100_Microwave_Sensor_Application_Note.pdf.

And it also was verified by me, as you can see in the jpg files. 

There is one tiny problem with my board. The retangular cutoff does not fit with HB100. This board functions well, but is not so pretty. And the distance has not been tested yet.
